    "# Data Visualization\n",

    "\n",
    "Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. <br>\n",
    "By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.<br>\n",
    "In the world of Big Data, data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyze massive amounts of information and make data-driven decisions<br>\n",
    "A dashboard is an information visualization tool. It helps you monitor events or activities at a glance by providing insights on one or more pages or screens. <br>\n",
    "Unlike an infographic, which presents a static graphical representation, a dashboard conveys real-time information by pulling complex data points directly from large data sets.<br>\n",
    "An interactive dashboard makes it easy to sort, filter, or drill into different types of data as needed.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Tableau and Microsoft PowerBI are widely used Data Visualization tools<br>"

    "### Advantages of Good Data Visualization\n",
    "Data visualization is another form of visual art that grabs our interest and keeps our eyes on the message.<br>\n",
    "When we see a chart, we quickly see trends and outliers.<br>\n",
    "If we can see something, we internalize it quickly. It’s storytelling with a purpose. <br>\n",
    "If you’ve ever stared at a massive spreadsheet of data and couldn’t see a trend, you know how much more effective a visualization can be.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TO Understand BigData\n",
    "As the “age of Big Data” kicks into high-gear, visualization is an increasingly key tool to make sense of the trillions of rows of data generated every day.<br>\n",
    "Data visualization helps to tell stories by curating data into a form easier to understand, highlighting the trends and outliers.<br>\n",
    "A good visualization tells a story, removing the noise from data and highlighting the useful information<br>\n",
    "The data and the visuals need to work together, and there’s an art to combining great analysis with great storytelling.<br>"
